## Timetable Project Reflection

## Overview of the Project
This project was about designing a simple webpage in HTML and CSS to represent a class timetable. The idea was to end up with an organized table format that includes information on the subjects that will be taken up, days of the week, time slots, subject code, lecture type, instructor's initials-making it more clear and user-friendly for any student or faculty member who would refer to this timetable.

## What I've Learned
I have been able to work more on structure in HTML and the design of tables in this project. I learned how to structure information that was somewhat complex into a table format using the elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>. I also went through some basic styling in CSS and inline styling for table borders, which allowed me to highlight the layout of the table and enhance readability. This project also helped me to practice effectively the use of tags and a structure hierarchy for cleanliness and cohesiveness of the page.

## Challenges Faced
It included making sure that the table layout stayed responsive across devices and different screen sizes. I had set up a basic stylesheet, but fine-tuning the responsiveness was beyond what I had anticipated and required further CSS knowledge. Others included how to clearly label each time slot with readable information without making it cluttered to the end user. Formatting the borders of each cell uniformly also took some trial and error.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
The strengths of this project include the attention to detail I have brought into this project and the way in which I am able to set information out logically. I was also able to employ basic concepts of HTML to generate a functional layout. I see now that I must work harder on CSS styling and responsiveness, as although functional, this current layout could most assuredly be made far more visually appealing and possibly even interactive, with the addition of some JavaScript. The double-checking to make sure that all of the details line up nice and neat when working with CSS is going to take a little more practice on my behalf.

## Future Improvement
Further improvement on this project would be to incorporate extra CSS to make the timetable look nicer, colouring each subject and time slot differently. I'll like to make it functional with JavaScript, enabling filtering or highlighting of subjects. This will be followed by making the table responsive, so that it may adjust well on mobile devices. I am considering implementing a hover effect as well to show more details for each class when users hover over a time slot.

## Conclusion
This project has been so rewarding for learning HTML and CSS it gave me great hands-on experience in structuring information and laying out user-friendly formats. I take pride in the progress I have made, yet I can still see that there is room for growth and ability to learn more skills. In this timetable, I feel I have learned that there is much good balance between design and functionality regarding the creation of a website, and I will be thrilled to be able to use those lessons again in another project.
