## Reflective Report on College Event Project

## Overview of Project
The College Events project involved the organization of events that were to be done and where students would be more interactive and have something to refer to in our institution. I had to come up with an information webpage summarizing the events, including their venues, times, and descriptions. This project wasn't just web development itself but also engaging with my peers on what kind of events would fit into their interests.

## What I've Learned
What I learned during this project is that in event planning, one needs to focus on making communication clear and organization neat. By designing the page, I managed to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS regarding structuring content and making it look good. Further, I gained some knowledge of time management since I needed to balance both this project and classwork at the university.

## Challenges Faced
One of the big challenges I experienced included having to coordinate details from multiple events that were happening simultaneously. Due to there being various programs at different times and venues, it was very important to have the information accurately represented. Additionally, I had technical problems styling the webpage, which at times made it irritating to get the layout as desired.

## How I Overcame Challenges
First, to address the problem of coordination, I made a checklist of all the information regarding the event in the order I was supposed to follow. Secondly, with respect to technical difficulties, I consulted online tutorials, forums, and discussions where people responded with useful advice. I asked my classmates who were more confident in their work with CSS specific problems, and learned from their reflections and solutions.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
One of the strengths I realized in this project was my readiness for adaptation and quick learning. I opened up my mind to new challenges and was proactive in finding solutions. On the other hand, one of my weaknesses was underestimating the time some tasks take. This made me rush over some tasks at the last minute. This experience showed me the need to improve my time management skills.

## Future Improvement
Building on this in the future will endeavor to give more realistic timescales for deadlines and break down complex tasks into smaller, simpler pieces. I will also be on the lookout for other projects that could give me experience with CSS and JavaScript to make webpages more dynamic and responsive. Meanwhile, seeking feedback from peers well in advance will help fine-tune the work before finalizing it.

## Conclusion
I can surely attest to my personal and professional growth with this college event project. It taught me the importance of teamwork, communicating effectively, and adapting to every condition that changes. I am proud of what we have been able to deliver as a final product, and I'm very excited to carry these skills with me to put into practice in future projects. Generally speaking, this project has motivated me to keep learning and trying to improve, not just in web development but throughout my academic journey.
