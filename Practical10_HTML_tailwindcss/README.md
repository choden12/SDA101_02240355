## Installation

If you want to view and experiment with this project locally, simply clone this repository and open `index.html` in the browser.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
## Usage
Above is a simple, responsive layout that includes a header, main content, and a footer. Hover over the button labeled "Hover Me!" to see this micro-interaction in action! Also, you can easily change colors and content for your own needs by editing the index.html and index.css file.

## Features
Full Responsive Design: Using TailwindCSS makes it easy and quick to build responsive designs on any screen size.
Micro Interaction: The main button has a hover interaction that enhances user interaction.
Custom Content: You can change content and styles easily for various uses.

## Technologies
HTML
TailwindCSS: Responsive and utility-first styling
Custom CSS: Additional styling and animations are at index.css.

##  Acknowledgments
I'd like to thank the developers and community behind TailwindCSS, such a versatile tool, and to all the online resources that helped me understand the concept of web development and micro-interactions.
