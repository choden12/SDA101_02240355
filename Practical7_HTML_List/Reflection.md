## Reflection My College List Project

## Overview of Project
For this project, I have created an HTML document that could be used to manage my information about college. I have included a list of my courses, daily schedule of classes, to-do lists, and study goals for each course. This document shall be used as some sort of personal planner to help me organize all of my academic goals and tasks.

## What I've Learned
This project taught me more about HTML structure, mainly using lists to organize information through <ul> and <ol>. I also learned one can use the <nav> tag for nav content and the importance of <h3> tags in creating organized headers for each section. I have also noticed that linking of external CSS files is quite important for improving the visual layout; this, however, remains a part I would like to develop further.

## Challenges Faced
One challenge was to make sure each section was laid out clearly, specifically separating my course goals. I also had a few minor HTML tag mistakes, for example, when I accidentally included a <p> tag inside of an ordered list <ol> and got some weird formatting. Secondly, it was a bit tricky figuring out how different sections were best arranged and how to best present the document in a nicely visual manner.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
One strong suit that I had with this project was my usage of lists to successfully organize elements. Lists allowed me to granulate information down to smaller pieces of data that then made the document easy to read. A weakness, on the other hand, would include my limited knowledge in CSS styling. While I put a heavy amount of focus on the structure in HTML, I could definitely see how a better grasp of CSS would greatly enhance the overall look and readability of my document.

## Future Improvement
Later on, I would like to work on adding additional CSS styling so that this document will look more pretty and organized. I'd like to practice different color combinations and font sizes, and different layout designs. I would also like to master my HTML skills so that tags are not being wasted using them in scenarios where they are not needed and to avoid formatting problems.

## Conclusion
The project as a whole was really quite valuable in learning for me. It allowed me to firm up my HTML knowledge and to create a personal organization tool, which I will continue to use in order to organize my studies. Challenges were definitely present, but I feel much more confident in my comprehension of HTML and look forward to improving my CSS knowledge to make the document more visually appealing.
