## Reflection on E-Commerce

## Overview of Project
The project is a simple ecommerce website that has to include multiple core sections: contact, a home page comprising the goals and products, and an order form of the product for the customer. Each page has its structure in HTML and design from accompanying CSS files. In this project, I sought to create a basic but functional and visually coherent website that would give users ease in browsing and shopping.

## What I have learned
During this project, I have been able to enhance my knowledge of structure in HTML and styling in CSS. I got used to using such elements of HTML as <div>, <header>, <nav>, <input>, and <select>. Making semantic groupings of sections for a website, including headers, navigation, and forms taught me how it is important to structure the content logically for user accessibility. I have also learned the use of CSS for styling, which improves the beauty and user experience of a website. I have also been experienced in linking external CSS files and using inline styles to provide consistency in the application of styles.

## Challenge Faced
One of the major challenges I had to overcome was making sure each section was well-organized and readable from one device to another. Sometimes, getting the layout to work, along with every link and image showing up properly, was hard. That was really with regard to different viewports. I also struggled to get the form elements to style and position consistently. I learned that structuring several HTML pages, each linking to CSS stylesheets, takes a long time regarding file management and paying great attention to detail-challenging but rewarding.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
One of the strengths in this project is paying attention to every tiny detail that may make each page well-formatted and user-friendly, with a clear design. Of course, one of the areas I have to work on is making my code in HTML and CSS more efficient and readable. Sometimes, I find myself writing redundant CSS that could be enhanced using advanced techniques such as the use of classes and inheritances. Responsiveness skills would be the other area for improvement, as it is hard for me to make the layout look equally good on both desktop and mobile views.

## Improvement to Be Done in Future
In the future, I would like my web pages to be more responsive. I would immediately dive deeper into CSS Flexbox and Grid for better structuring of my layouts on a wide range of screen sizes. I also know that learning more about JavaScript would allow me to add interactivity to these forms and improve the overall experience. Adding some kind of validation to the form inputs would help users correctly fill out forms and would provide quick feedback to the user.

## Conclusion
This project gave me an excellent opportunity to put into practice making a simple e-commerce website. I'm proud of how I've done so far and look forward to expanding my skills in web development. By going out of my comfort zone and trying to solve these challenges, I know HTML and CSS a lot better now, and am confident with the creation and styling of web pages. Further learning for me means I'm excited about bringing in even more advanced functionality and design elements into future projects.
