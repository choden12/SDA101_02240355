## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-college-list.git
```
## Usage

After setting up the project in :
Home Page: home.html would give an overview of what the site is about and the main purpose for that website.
Product Page: The products.html page would let the customers pick certain products as well as price information about those particular products.
Contact Page: For company contact information, e.g., email, phone, and social media, look at the file called contact.html.
Order Form: Includes a customer details form in the product.html that allows users to input their details and preferred product, means of payment, and delivery date.

## Features
Clearly Indicated Contact Information: Includes a very simplistic contact section that contains an email, telephone numbers, and social media.
Navigation Bar: This will let users move between the home, products, and contact pages.
Product Selection Form: This form enables the user to fill in his or her details, select a product, choose the means of payment, and accept the terms.
Responsiveness: The layout is structured to be responsive and functional across different devices.

## Technologies
This project is powered with:
HTML5: Markup
CSS3: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Not used in this simple version. But there is great potential for enhancements.
