# Registration Form with Validation

This is a simple web-based registration form with the implementation of validation by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It checks the user input regarding username, email, password, and confirm password for validity and to avoid errors. It shows the error message if the user input does not match with the specified criteria.

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository into your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/choden12/SDA101_02240355.git

## Usage
The form consists of username, email, password and password confirm fields. Thus, the following list gives the summary of the validation rules for them:

"Submit" button is disabled until all fields are valid.
Error messages guide the user to input correctly.
